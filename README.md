# Blot
This is my approach to achieve scientific plotting akin to Matlab/Matplotlib in Blender.


### Special Blender Config (File internal)
- Under Render > Color Management > View Transform > Select "Raw"
  This leads to a very basic shading, which is perfect for this usecase.
### Special Blender Config (Global)
Didn't have to do anything here yet (luckily).
